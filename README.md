this is a small, experimental HTML view library for [scala-js](https://www.scala-js.org/) inspired by phil freeman's [sdom](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-sdom).

have a look at [Views.scala](modules/example/src/main/scala/Views.scala) to get an idea how views are created.

to try out the todo-mv demo, just run ```sbt demo```.
